Also the military use of these type of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has grown because of their ability to operate in dangerous locations while keeping their human operators at a safe distance. A quadcopter, also called quadrotor helicopter is multi-rotor copter with four arms, each of which have a motor and a propeller at their ends. Quadcopters are similar to helicopters in some ways, though their lift and thrust comes from four propellers, rather than just one. 1. Our idea is to design the quadcopter that when left in unknown terrains can give us live video stream on our laptops and also store it according to the need\n2. Automate it so that it can act by judging its surroundings, perform various actions/maneuverers by determining its position and environment\n 3. These quad copters can be sent in evacuated buildings and in bio-chemical factories to act as first respondents, and call for cajole by manoeuvring either autonomously or controlling it through Brain\n4. It can also be used to autonomously model unknown environments using distance measuring sensors and decide its path accordingly"

			"name": "Multi Actuator Switch Mode Hydraulic System",
			"description": "Current hydraulic systems involving multiple actuators and a single hydraulic power supply generally have poor efficiency. Using throttling valves to control multiple actuators requires meeting the highest pressure requirement and the total flow of all of actuators. When there is a large difference in the pressure requirement of the actuators, fluid throttling results in significant energy losses. The purpose of this project is to implement switch-mode control in a multi-actuator circuit and demonstrate the improvement in efficiency over a traditional hydraulic system with throttling valve control. This will reduce energy losses and result in improved efficiency for usage of multiple actuators with a single hydraulic power source. This idea utilises the input from both the tank and the pump. Using varying amounts of fluid coming from both sources, we can create various pressure and flow values for different actuators and in the process increase the efficiency of the system by operating the actuators at their rated pressures and flows. The usages of this project vary from heavy duty hydraulic cranes to hydraulic lifts. This new technology, once implemented on a larger scale in realistic applications, will reduce losses in hydraulic systems that depend on multiple actuators to function."

The robot will achieve this task whilst the line being under live condition. Present methods of inspection include Helicopter surveillance and Human inspection. Helicopter surveillance is done by a lineman using helicopter and it is highly risky. The second method includes human inspection. In this lineman climbs on the transmission line and checks out all the faults and repairs them and this method is also highly risky and time consuming.The robotic system consists of a robot equipped with:\n1. A high definition video camera providing live feeds of transmission line \n2. Infrared (Thermal) camera providing the locations of hotspots\n3. Wire clamper and bolt lightener\n4. Wireless assembly providing control upto 2km.\nThe robotic system is manually controlled through a wireless remote. The video and infrared cameras provide live feeds which are transmitted wirelessly. The receiver kept near operator receives the live feeds and then they are displayed on the screen. The operator can then control the robotic system to repair the broken strands and can also analyze the hotspots. Loose bolts can be tightened by using the assembly mounted for tightening the bolts.This way the system will minimize the human work, increase efficiency and reduce dangers in maintaining and repairing the transmission lines."

			"description": "Some special people are usually deprived of normal communication with other people in the society. It has been observed that they find it really difficult at times to interact with normal people with their gestures , as only a very few of those are recognized by most people. Since people with hearing impairment cannot talk like normal people so they have to depend on some sort of visual communication in most of the time. Visual-gestural language is their primary means of expression which involves various hand gestures , facial expressions like eyebrow movement and lip-mouth movement. What we aim to achieve ? The idea is to make computers to understand human language and develop a user friendly human computer interfaces (HCI). Making a computer understand speech, facial expressions and human gestures are some steps towards it thereby making a translation system that can successfully convert this visual gestural language into digital English text or speech."
